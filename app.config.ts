 * identifier, same slot on the device — so installing one used to mean losing the other. Under
 * `APP_VARIANT=development` the ids, name and scheme all change, and the two apps sit side by side.
 *
 * `slug` and `extra.eas.projectId` deliberately do not change: both variants are the same EAS
 * project, so builds and credentials stay in one place.
